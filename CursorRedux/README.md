CursorRedux
===========

A re-do of my CursorMirror mini project! Should be more efficient... the previous version was emitting the entire array of clients and cursor positions whenever a single client moved their cursor. This version only emits the new co-ordinates of the client that moved their mouse.

As it stands, I need to re-do the client side. The server side should work (ish) as is.
